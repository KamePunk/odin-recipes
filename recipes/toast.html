    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Bread of your choice</li>
    <li>Topping of your choice. We like butter here but peanut butter is also good!</li>
</ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Preheat your grill to high heat or preheat your oven to 400 degrees F or use a toaster.</li> 
<li>In a medium bowl, stir together the goat cheese, lemon juice and thyme.</li> 
<li>Place the bread on a baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil on both sides of each slice, season with salt and pepper.</li>
<li>Place the bread on the grill and grill both for about 15 minutes per side or until extremely toasted.</li>
<li>Wait until you can almost smell a fire.</li>
<li>Once it's completely black, it's ready to go!</li> 
<li>Now throw it away!</li>
